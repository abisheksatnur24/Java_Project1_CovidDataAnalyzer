# Java_Project1_CovidDataAnalyzer

This project makes use of the node and GUI classes from the VirginiaTech CS2 library for the purpose of visualizing and managing covid related data

**Phase 1** UML Diagram Creation 
My team and I created a relationship UML model of all the classes we wanted to incorporate in our project. 
This gave us a structured view of how we wanted to build and relate all classes in our project.

**Phase 2** Class Stub creation and Unit Testing
We created skeleton classes containing method headers and javadocs and then
created test classes and test methods for all class methods in the skeleton classes using the VirginiaTech CS2 library. 

**Phase 3** Class Implemtation 
We fleshed out class methods for each class.
Few changes had to be made to the UML and class structure at this point, in additions to extra methods being added to a few classes.
(Next time try and create a UML that has a class structure with very less dependancy one tasks. Each class should be as independant as possible)

**Phase 4** Debugging
Ran into 2 null pointer exceptions, fixed them with no major change in class structure or UML

ADTs used: 
* Linked List used to store data. 
* Insertion sort used to sort data.
